# Simple CRM Project

This is a basic command-line CRM application with separate modules for Sales and Marketing.

## Structure
- `main.py`: The main entry point of the application.
- `database.py`: A simple in-memory dictionary acting as a database.
- `sales/`: Contains all sales-related logic (leads, customers).
- `marketing/`: Contains all marketing-related logic (campaigns).

## How to Run

To start the application, run the `main.py` file from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```
