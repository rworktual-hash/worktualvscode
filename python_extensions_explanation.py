print("\nIn Python, the term 'extension' can have three common meanings:")

print("\n1. File Extensions:")
print("These are the suffixes at the end of a file name that tell the operating system what kind of file it is.")
print("- .py: A standard Python source code file.")
print("- .pyc: A compiled bytecode file, which Python generates to run code faster.")
print("- .pyd: A Python module written in another language (like C/C++) that works like a DLL on Windows.")

print("\n2. C/C++ Extensions (Extension Modules):")
print("These are pre-compiled modules written in C or C++ that can be imported and used in Python.")
print("They are often used to:")
print("- Improve performance for computationally intensive tasks.")
print("- Allow Python to use existing C/C++ libraries.")
print("Examples include popular libraries like NumPy and pandas.")

print("\n3. VS Code Extensions:")
print("In the context of an editor like VS Code, an extension is a plugin that adds functionality.")
print("For Python, extensions provide features like debugging, code completion (IntelliSense), linting, and code formatting.")
